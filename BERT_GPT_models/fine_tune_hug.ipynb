        "- **Transformer architecture** 🏗️: Uses self-attention mechanisms to understand the context of words in a sentence, both from the left and right (bidirectional).\n",
        "- **Pre-trained on large corpora** 🌐: BERT is trained on massive datasets (like Wikipedia and BooksCorpus) to learn general language representations.\n",
        "- **Fine-tuning** 🛠️: After pre-training, BERT can be adapted (fine-tuned) for specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or text classification.\n",
        "- **Sequence classification** 🧩: BERT can take a sequence of text and output a prediction (e.g., the sentiment label for a review).\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT’s deep understanding of language context makes it highly effective for NLP tasks, including classifying Yelp reviews by sentiment."

        "\n",
        "While BERT is a bidirectional transformer model designed for deep language understanding, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) uses a unidirectional (left-to-right) transformer architecture. Here’s how GPT differs and how it can be applied to sequence classification tasks like Yelp review sentiment analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Architecture** 🏗️  \n",
        "    - **GPT** is based on the transformer decoder stack, processing text in a left-to-right fashion.  \n",
        "    - Unlike BERT, GPT does not use token type embeddings or segment embeddings, focusing solely on predicting the next token in a sequence.\n",
        "    - GPT’s attention mechanism only attends to previous tokens, making it naturally suited for generative tasks but also effective for classification when fine-tuned.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pre-training Objective** 🎯  \n",
        "    - GPT is pre-trained using a language modeling objective (predicting the next word), while BERT uses masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\n",
        "    - This difference means GPT learns strong generative capabilities, while BERT excels at understanding context from both directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fine-tuning for Classification** 🏷️  \n",
        "    - For sentiment classification, GPT can be adapted by adding a classification head on top of the final hidden state of the last token.\n",
        "    - The model is fine-tuned on labeled review data, learning to map review text to star ratings (1-5).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Workflow in This Notebook** 📚  \n",
        "    - The GPT tokenizer and model are loaded from Hugging Face’s model hub (`openai-gpt`).\n",
        "    - The same training and evaluation pipeline is used as with BERT, ensuring a fair comparison.\n",
        "    - Accuracy is computed using the same metric, allowing direct performance comparison between BERT and GPT on Yelp review classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Differences in Usage** 🔑  \n",
        "    - GPT does not require `token_type_ids` for input.\n",
        "    - Tokenization and padding are handled with the GPT tokenizer, which may have different vocabulary and max length settings compared to BERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "By fine-tuning GPT for sequence classification, we can explore how generative transformer models perform on sentiment analysis tasks and compare their strengths and weaknesses to BERT-based approaches. This provides valuable insights into model selection for NLP applications. 🚀📊\n"
